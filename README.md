# Scope:
This project was inspired by this udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-ecommerce/">course</a>. 
It's a full stack nextjs app complete with auth, payment and admin dashboard.

# key learning points:
1- form validation with react-hook-form
2- authentication with next-auth
3- authorization with route protection. Admin only routes and normal users only routes
4- backend routes creation. It's quite snappy and straighforward.
5- Nextjs routing stuff is quite on another level compared to react-router-dom
6- on-page SEO. This one was quite an eye opener for me.
